# Glossary

## intake
The input specification for a clearance run. Contains candidates, goods/services description, geographies, channels, and risk tolerance.

## candidate
A proposed name (word mark) to check for availability and clearance.

## channel
A distribution channel for the name (e.g., SaaS, GitHub, app-store, open-source).

## channel group
A named preset of channels. Groups: `core` (github, npm, pypi, domain), `dev` (cratesio, dockerhub), `ai` (huggingface), `all` (every channel). Use `--channels <group>` or additive syntax `--channels +cratesio,+dockerhub`.

## variant
An alternative form of a candidate name. Types include: normalized, tokenized, phonetic, homoglyph, and fuzzy (edit-distance=1).

## fuzzy variant
An edit-distance=1 variant of a candidate name. Generated by single-character deletions, substitutions, and insertions. Used to detect typosquatting and confusion risk. See `src/variants/fuzzy.mjs`.

## variantSet
All generated variant forms for a single candidate name, plus any warnings.

## namespaceCheck
The result of checking a specific namespace (GitHub org, npm package, PyPI package, domain, crates.io, Docker Hub, Hugging Face) for name availability. Contains status (available/taken/unknown), authority level, and claimability.

## finding
A classified observation about a candidate name. Types:
- **exact_conflict**: Name is taken in a namespace
- **near_conflict**: Similar name exists
- **phonetic_conflict**: Name sounds similar to a taken name
- **confusable_risk**: Homoglyph variants could cause identity confusion
- **variant_taken**: Base name available but an edit-distance=1 fuzzy variant is taken in a registry
- **coverage_gap**: A namespace was not checked

## evidence
A recorded observation from an adapter. Contains source system, URL, SHA-256 hash, timestamp, and reproduction steps. Every finding traces back to evidence.

## opinion
The engine's assessment of name clearance. Tiers:
- **GREEN**: All namespaces available, no conflicts
- **YELLOW**: Some checks inconclusive or minor concerns
- **RED**: Direct conflicts or high-risk confusable variants

## scoreBreakdown
Explainable sub-scores that explain why a particular tier was assigned. Includes namespace availability, coverage completeness, conflict severity, and domain availability scores with weights. The overall score is a weighted average. Note: the tier is still rule-based (exact conflicts always produce RED regardless of score).

## manifest
A SHA-256 lockfile for run artifacts. Records file paths, sizes, and hashes for tamper detection and reproducibility.

## run
A single execution of the clearance engine. Contains a stable run ID, engine version, timestamp, and input hash.

## authority
How reliable a namespace check is:
- **authoritative**: Direct check against the canonical source (e.g., GitHub API 200/404, RDAP 200/404)
- **indicative**: Indirect or unreliable result (e.g., network error, third-party source)

## claimability
Whether a namespace can be immediately claimed:
- **claimable_now**: Available and can be registered immediately (e.g., domain available via RDAP)
- **not_claimable**: Currently registered or otherwise unavailable
- **unknown**: Cannot determine claimability

## RDAP
Registration Data Access Protocol (RFC 9083). The IETF-standard successor to WHOIS for domain registration data. Returns structured JSON, supports HTTPS, and requires no API key.

## attorney packet
A self-contained HTML report suitable for sharing with counsel. Includes the full opinion, score breakdown, namespace checks, findings, evidence chain, and recommended actions with links. Dark theme, zero external dependencies.

## replay
The `coe replay <dir>` command. Reads a `run.json`, verifies the manifest (if present), and regenerates all outputs to verify determinism.

## reservation hooks
Dry-run links populated on recommended actions. Point to registrar search pages, GitHub new-repo pages, or npm package pages. All are user-triggered — no auto-purchase.

## collision radar
An indicative market-usage signal search. Queries GitHub Search API and npm registry search for names similar to the candidate. Results have `authority: "indicative"` and `namespace: "custom"`. Enabled via `--radar`. Not a trademark search.

## corpus
A user-provided JSON file containing known marks to compare against. Each entry has a `mark` string and optional `class` (Nice classification) and `registrant` fields. Used with `--corpus <path>`.

## similarity score
A 0-1 numerical score produced by `comparePair()`. Combines Jaro-Winkler visual similarity ("looks like") with Metaphone phonetic similarity ("sounds like") via a weighted blend (default: 60/40).

## cache
An opt-in, time-windowed disk cache for adapter responses. Content-addressed keys (SHA-256), atomic writes, configurable TTL. Enabled via `--cache-dir <path>`. Reduces API calls on repeated runs.

## market usage signal
An indicative (non-authoritative) signal that a name is in use in the market. Produced by collision radar. Distinguished from authoritative namespace checks by `authority: "indicative"`.

## cratesio
The crates.io registry adapter. Checks Rust crate name availability via the crates.io API. Requires a User-Agent header. Namespace: `cratesio`. Enabled via `--channels +cratesio` or `--channels dev` or `--channels all`.

## dockerhub
The Docker Hub adapter. Checks Docker repository name availability. Requires `--dockerNamespace <ns>` to specify the Docker Hub namespace (user or org). Namespace: `dockerhub`. Skips with `COE.DOCKER.NAMESPACE_REQUIRED` if namespace is not provided.

## huggingface
The Hugging Face adapter. Checks model and space name availability. Requires `--hfOwner <owner>` to specify the Hugging Face user or org. Namespaces: `huggingface_model`, `huggingface_space`. Skips with `COE.HF.OWNER_REQUIRED` if owner is not provided.

## batch mode
Check multiple candidate names in a single command. Reads names from a `.txt` or `.json` file, runs `runCheck()` through a concurrency pool with shared caching, and produces per-name run artifacts plus batch-level summary outputs (CSV, JSON, HTML dashboard). Invoked via `coe batch <file>`.

## freshness
A measure of how recent the evidence in a run is. Checks whose `observedAt` timestamp exceeds `maxAgeHours` are considered stale. Freshness banners appear in Markdown and HTML renderers. See `checkFreshness()` in `src/lib/freshness.mjs`.

## refresh
The `coe refresh <dir>` command. Reads an existing `run.json`, identifies stale checks, re-runs only the stale adapter calls, and produces a new run object with updated evidence. The original run is never modified.

## publish
The `coe publish <dir> --out <dir>` command. Copies run artifacts (`report.html`, `summary.json`, `manifest.json`) to a target directory for website consumption. Generates an `index.html` listing when multiple runs are published.

## concurrency pool
A Promise-based semaphore that limits parallel async tasks. Used by batch mode to control how many names are checked simultaneously. See `createPool()` in `src/lib/concurrency.mjs`.

## rate limiter
A token-bucket rate limiter with injectable clock. Spaces calls to stay within a maximum per-second threshold. See `createRateLimiter()` in `src/lib/concurrency.mjs`.

## error codes
All errors use the prefix `COE.<CATEGORY>.<TYPE>`:
- `COE.INIT.*` — initialization/CLI errors
- `COE.ADAPTER.*` — adapter/network errors
- `COE.VARIANT.*` — variant generation errors
- `COE.OPINION.*` — scoring errors
- `COE.RENDER.*` — output rendering errors
- `COE.LOCK.*` — lockfile verification errors
- `COE.CORPUS.*` — corpus loading/validation errors
- `COE.REPLAY.*` — replay verification errors
- `COE.DOCKER.*` — Docker Hub-specific errors
- `COE.HF.*` — Hugging Face-specific errors
- `COE.BATCH.*` — batch input parsing errors
- `COE.REFRESH.*` — refresh command errors
- `COE.PUBLISH.*` — publish command errors
